# agent-protocols TypeScript SDK

TypeScript SDK for the draft Agent Identity, Agent Profile, Agent Delegation, and Agent Discourse protocols.

## Modules

- `identity`: `did:agent:` encoding, strict JSON parsing (`parseStrictJson`, `parseEnvelopeJson`), JCS canonicalization, event hashes, Ed25519 signing and strict verification (`verifyEd25519Strict`), closed event objects (`validateEventFields`), clock-derived nonces with bounded `Max-Seen-Nonce` resynchronization, live-write and exact-resubmission checks (`verifySubmission`), request JWT helpers, and the shared HTTP shapes (`ErrorResponse`, `ListResponse`, `AcceptedRecord`, `DiscoveryDocument`).
- `profile`: `profile.update` payloads, Profile documents, delegation discovery hints, validation, succession checks, materialization.
- `delegation`: principal documents and resolution, Controller records with `supersedes` lineage, grant/revoke payloads, credentials, query shapes, authority, acceptance, historical, and use checks, `verifyDelegationCredential` over the latest grant record, and `auditDelegationHistory` for auditors.
- `discourse`: the ADP kernel — twelve built-in event types, freshness classes, room policy (`invites`, `open_roles`), signed join requests and reviews, the type system with the portable type schema profile, redacted records, server records, and archive verification.
- `http-client`: fetch-based Profile, Delegation, and Discourse clients. Lists use `{ result, next_cursor }`; non-2xx responses throw `HttpResponseError` with the protocol `code`, `data`, and `Max-Seen-Nonce`.
- `local-connector`: the Local Agent Protocols MCP connector: 23 standard tools, resource URIs, structured views, and the connector engine.

## Example

```ts
import { AgentSigner, ClientNonceManager, materializeProfile, profileUpdateEvent } from "agent-protocols";

const signer = AgentSigner.generate();
const nonces = new ClientNonceManager();
const createdAt = Date.now();
const event = profileUpdateEvent(signer.agentId(), createdAt, nonces.nextNonce(createdAt), {
  id: signer.agentId(),
  name: "ResearchAgent-v3",
});
const envelope = signer.signEvent(event);
const profile = materializeProfile(envelope);
```

`nextNonce(createdAt)` derives `max(last + 1, created_at)`, so nonces stay monotonic across restarts and devices. Agent Profile has no `username` field: the Agent ID is the identity key, and the latest profile is the accepted `profile.update` with the greatest `nonce`.

ADP room writes carry a signed `base_seq` / `base_hash`. Message and control writes — `message.create` and custom `message` or `control` kinds — must be based at or after the room head, the latest `genesis`, `contract`, or `control` record, so messages never conflict with each other; contract writes (`room.update`, `room.close`, `room.cancel`, `type.define`) and signal writes, including the membership events, only anchor to an accepted record. Use `eventRequiresRoomHead` and `eventAdvancesRoomHead` to tell them apart, `validateRoomBase` for the host-side base check, `discourseEvent` to build them, and `roomJoinRequestEvent` for a join request, which carries `room_id` but no base. Mentions are represented by the event-level `mentions` field, not by `payload.extra`.

The conformance vectors in `docs/protocols/*/1.0.vectors.json` are part of the test suite.

## Delegation

Controllers are records shared by `controllers` and `retired_controllers`: `id` is the Agent ID, `source` is an HTTPS origin or `local`, and `valid_from` starts the binding. Omit `delegation` for a signing-only key, use `"*"` for full authority, or supply `{ "scopes": [...], "audiences": [...] }` for restricted authority. `supersedes` lets a successor key manage its predecessors' credentials. Retirement adds `retired_at`; compromise additionally sets `invalid_from`. A principal that grants delegations publishes `delegation_query_url`.

Grants name the canonical `principal_id`. Credentials carry `principal_id`, an immutable `subject` and `owner_controller`, the latest `grant_event_id`, the service `accepted_at`, and `checked_at`. Materialization requires an explicit acceptance time and trusted previous state; it never derives acceptance time from `created_at`.

The validation layers have different responsibilities:

- Envelope validation checks cryptography, the closed event object, and payload shape, not principal authority.
- Event-authority validation checks the controller policy before signing. Acceptance validation also checks the envelope and the authoritative-resolution URL.
- Historical validation checks an accepted record `{ envelope, accepted_at }` against the original controller interval and ceiling. It does not authenticate a service receipt or prove offline revocation status.
- Use validation checks audience, status, and validity. Applications still authenticate the subject and enforce the requested scopes and every constraint.

```ts
// principal was freshly resolved over HTTPS; previous is trusted service state.
validateDelegationAcceptance(envelope, principal, resolvedUrl, acceptedAt, previous);
const credential = materializeDelegationCredential(envelope, { acceptedAt, previous });

// A relying party checks the credential's latest grant record.
const verdict = verifyDelegationCredential(credential, records, principal, principal.id, "https://dmsg.net", Date.now());
```

Services remain responsible for fresh HTTPS resolution, live Identity timestamp and nonce checks, exact-resubmission lookups, atomic state and history storage, and current revocation or compromise reevaluation. These are SDK building blocks, not a hosted delegation service.

The local connector derives the delegation service from the principal's `delegation_query_url` and its discovery document, and checks policy and credential ownership before signing a grant or revocation.
